# Beyond the Mountains of Madness Theme for Fantasy Grounds

I made this to be used with my group. Includes PSDs (in /assets) so you can customize the graphics (e.g. to remove spoilers).

To use, create a folder the FG extensions folder and throw everything in there. Delete the 'assets' folder if you don't want your players downloading unnecessary PSDs.
